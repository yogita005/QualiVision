QualiVision is an AI-powered smart factory quality control system designed to optimize product inspection and defect detection in industrial manufacturing environments.
By combining computer vision, intelligent data processing, and traditional factory integration methods, QualiVision provides a modern approach to automated quality assurance while maintaining cost-efficiency and simplicity.
It leverages deep learning, specifically a ResNet-18-based convolutional neural network, to accurately identify defects in products using image classification and localization.
